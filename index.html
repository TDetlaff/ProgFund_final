        You wake up to find yourself lying on the ground. The air is damp, stale, and reeks of something awful.
        Stumbling to your feet, you inspect your surroundings. All around you are the carcasses of old, rusted-out machinery.

        Suddenly, you hear a voice shouting down a long corridor behind you, "Hey you, stop!".
